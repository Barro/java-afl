This is a fork server based approach to fuzz Java applications on Java
virtual machine with [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Tested with:

* afl 2.52b
* OpenJDK 1.8.0_151

Speed:

* Fork server mode around 600 executions/second for a program that
  does nothing. Closer to 300 when there is actually something
  happening.
* Persistent mode around 10000 executions/second. Highly depends on
  how much JVM is able to optimize.

## Usage

TODO description and easy to use implementation.

Instrument:

```
$ export CLASSPATH=asm-6.1.jar:out/
$ java -Djava.library.path=out/ JavaAflInstrument out/ClassToInstrument.class
```

Fuzz. JVM allocates on my Debian system around 10 gigabytes of virtual
memory. You might find [recidivm](http://jwilk.net/software/recidivm)
useful in estimating memory limits:

```
$ java-afl-fuzz -m 20000 -i in/ -o out/ -- java -Djava.library.path=out/ ClassToInstrument
```

## Building

You need to have [ASM 6.1](http://asm.ow2.org/) to build this as a
dependency in addition to Java 8 and afl build dependencies. Currently
there is a crude build script to build and test this implementation:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

## Greetz

* Great thanks to [Micha≈Ç Zalewski](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/) for
  [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl), a crude but
  effective fuzzer. Especially the idea of using a bitmap and randomly
  generated program locations as a fast probabilistic memory bound
  approximation of the program execution path.
* Inspired by [python-afl](http://jwilk.net/software/python-afl) and
  [Kelinci](https://github.com/isstac/kelinci).
