This is a fork server based approach to fuzz Java applications on Java
virtual machine with
[american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

## Usage

Fuzzing with american fuzzy lop works by instrumenting the compiled
Java bytecode with probabilistic program coverage revealing
instrumentation. There are general types of instrumeting fuzzing modes
in programs that can be fuzzed with `afl-fuzz` command. The default
fork server mode does not need any modifications to the program source
code and can work as is. There are also more efficient deferred fork
server and persistent modes that enable you to skip some
initialization code and keep the JVM running longer than for just one
input.

First you need to instrument a program that you have. This is done by
running the built `java-afl-instrument.jar` and instrumenting each jar
or class file that you want to include in your program. No source code
modifications are necessary to get started:

```bash
$ java -jar java-afl-instrument.jar instrumented/ ClassToTest.class
$ java -jar java-afl-instrument.jar instrumented/ jar-to-test.jar
```

As instrumentation injects native JNI code into the used files, so you
can only run these files on similar enough systems that
`java-afl-instrument.jar` was run on.

Then you are ready to fuzz your Java application with `afl-fuzz`. It
can be done with this type of command with the provided
`java-afl-fuzz` wrapper script:

```bash
$ java-afl-fuzz -m 20000 -i in/ -o /dev/shm/fuzz-out/ -- java -cp instrumented/ ClassToTest
$ java-afl-fuzz -m 20000 -i in/ -o /dev/shm/fuzz-out/ -- java -jar instrumented/jar-to-test.jar
```

Parameters are having following functions:

* `-i in/`: Input directory of initial data that then gets modified
  over the fuzzing process.
* `-o /dev/shm/fuzz-out/`: Output directory for fuzzing state
  data. This should always be on a shared memory drive and never in a
  directory pointing to a physical hard drive.
* `-m 20000`: Higher virtual memory limit that enables JVM to run, as
  the default memory limit in `afl-fuzz` is 50 megabytes. JVM can
  allocate around 10 gigabytes of virtual memory by default.

More detailed description of available options can be found from
[american fuzzy lop's README](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/README.txt). You
may also want to adjust maximum heap size with
[`-Xmx`](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15523_01/web.1111/e13814/jvm_tuning.htm#PERFM164)
option to be smaller than the default if you fuzz multiple JVM
instances on the same machine to keep memory usage sane.

### Advanced usage

More efficient deferred and persistent modes start each fuzzing
iteration later than at the beginning of `main()` function. Using
deferred or persistent mode requires either a special annotation for
the `main()` function or `--custom-init` flag to the instrument
program:


```java
public class ProgramCustom {
    @javafl.CustomInit
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Or you can instrument unmodified code in such way that the init
function does not need to reside inside `main()` by making
`--custom-init` as the first parameter:

```bash
$ java -jar java-afl-instrument.jar --custom-init instrumented/ ClassToTest.class
$ java -jar java-afl-instrument.jar --custom-init instrumented/ jar-to-test.jar
```

To put the application into deferred mode where all the initialization
code that comes before `javafl.JavaAfl.init()` function can be done in
following fashion:

```java
public class ProgramPersistent {
    @javafl.CustomInit
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ...
        javafl.JavaAfl.init();
        // You need to read the actual input after initialization point.
        System.in.read(data_buffer);
        ... do actual input processing...
    }
}
```

To put the program into a persistent mode you need wrap the part that
you want to execute around a `while (javafl.JavaAfl.loop(<iterations>))`
loop. If you read the input from `System.in`, you need to take care
that you flush Java's buffering on it after you have read your data:

```java
public class ProgramPersistent {
    @javafl.CustomInit
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ...
        byte[] data = new byte[128];
        int read = 128;
        while (javafl.JavaAfl.loop(100000)) {
            read = System.in.read(data, 0, data.length);
            // Throw away all buffering information from stdin for the
            // next iteration:
            System.in.skip(9999999);
            ... do actual input processing...
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

## Building

You need to have [ASM 6.1](http://asm.ow2.org/) to build this as a
dependency in addition to Java 8 and afl build dependencies. Currently
there is a crude build script to build and test this implementation:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Even though building requires Java 8, this should be able to
instrument programs that run only on some older versions of Java.

TODO description and various more portable and usable build tools.

## Performance

Performance numbers on Intel Core i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz with OpenJDK
1.8.0_151 and afl 2.52b:

* Fork server mode around 750 executions/second for a program that
  does nothing. Closer to 300 when there is actually something
  happening.
* Deferred mode naturally gets something between the fork server mode
  and persistent mode. Depends how heavy the initialization is,
  probably maybe some tens of percents.
* Persistent mode around 14000 executions/second. Highly depends on
  how much and how long JVM is able to optimize before being
  killed. Around 31000 iterations/second for an empty while loop, that
  is close to the maximum that native C code can handle with `afl-fuzz`
  in persistent mode.

## TODO

* Retry overly big functions with smaller instrumentation ratio.
* Support deferred init for arbitrary given method without source code
  modifications.
* Better way to build this. Multiple different build tools are
  probably a must.
  * Also support including afl's config.h file for map size and file
    descriptor information.
* Alternative method implementations based on fuzzing mode (similar to
  C preprocessor's #ifdef/#ifndef). Probably somehow with annotations
  or `System.getProperty("FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION")`.

## Greetz

* Great thanks to [Micha≈Ç Zalewski](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/) for
  [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl), a crude but
  effective fuzzer. Especially the idea of using a bitmap and randomly
  generated program locations as a fast probabilistic memory bound
  approximation of the program execution path.
* Inspired by [python-afl](http://jwilk.net/software/python-afl) and
